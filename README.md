## Details
As a hobbyist, I'm hoping to set goals via the roadmap above and learn some cool stuff along the way. I'm starting simple, with some pretty basic services and MVC. When I get the time I want to convert everything to RxSwift/RxCocoa w/ Action, and then use it as the MO going forward (so the earlier I do so, the better). 

I'm a software project manager by career, so this tool could one day very much help in logging time, updating existing task lists and just generally being more aware of what's happening in teamwork (my current employer's tool of choice). My goal is to push myself by making the work public, without any real shits given for who is watching. That said - if you happen to end up here, I'm always open to feedback and input, but I doubt this repo will get to the point of pull requests.


##### Personal note: this is a personal project meant for exploring Reactive Extensions, MVVM, implementing web services, and any other cool shit I come across. If you stumble upon this, feedback and input are always welcome.
