# TimeLogger
App for working with the Teamwork API, specifically aimed at making the time entry experience more user friendly, especially for PM's.

## Roadmap
- [ ] API integration and basic router (progressive improvements follow)
- [ ] Secure user login and persistence
- [ ] Project selection and favoriting
- [ ] Edit, copy and log time entries
- [ ] Multi-task timer
- [ ] Task creation

## Along the Way
Hoping to first do a standard implementation, writing the network layer using Alamofire. Also planning to support offline browsing via a firebase integration, and somewhere along the way adopt RFP to create real-time views of time logs and tasks.
